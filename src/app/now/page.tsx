        I&apos;m currently developing my new personal website. In my last one I
        used some AI and the UI is not up to my standards. I plan to completely
        change that with this new website. AI will be used ONLY for assistance
        with dumb questions and nonimportant things. Also the UI will be more my
        tempo. I want to understand my website while making it look nice.
